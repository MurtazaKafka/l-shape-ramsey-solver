# L-shape Ramsey Problem: Findings and Solutions

## Problem Definition

The L-shape Ramsey problem asks for a coloring of an n×n grid with k colors such that no monochromatic L-shape appears. An L-shape consists of three points where two points are equidistant from the third point, forming a right angle.

For example, in a grid, an L-shape could be formed by points at coordinates:
- (0,0), (0,2), (2,2)
- (1,1), (1,3), (3,3)
- (4,2), (2,2), (2,0)

## Approaches and Patterns

We explored several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using patterns of the form (a*i + b*j) % num_colors
   - Formula (i + 2*j) % 3 works for 3×3 grids
   - Fails on larger grids due to repeating patterns

2. **Block Patterns**: Dividing the grid into blocks with different coloring schemes
   - Works for some specific grid sizes (e.g., 6×6)
   - Complex to generalize for arbitrary sizes

3. **Quadrant-Based**: Treating each quadrant with different patterns
   - Helps avoid monochromatic L-shapes across quadrants
   - Requires special treatment at boundaries

4. **Latin Square Patterns**: Using modified Latin squares
   - Effective for small grids (3×3)
   - Needs extensions for larger grids

5. **Quasi-Periodicity**: Using irrational numbers (golden ratio) to create non-repeating patterns
   - Works for some sizes with additional fixes
   - Can be effective for 5×5 grids

## Key Findings

1. **Pattern Dependence**: Different grid sizes require different patterns to avoid monochromatic L-shapes.

2. **3×3 Grid Solution**: The pattern (i + 2*j) % 3 works perfectly for 3×3 grids and produces a valid coloring with no monochromatic L-shapes.

3. **Larger Grid Challenges**: As grid size increases, finding valid colorings becomes more challenging due to the increased number of possible L-shapes.

4. **Boundary Issues**: Most patterns fail at boundaries or when the pattern repeats in larger grids, creating monochromatic L-shapes.

5. **Specialized Approaches**: Each grid size seems to require a specialized approach rather than a universal solution.

## Successful Patterns

1. **3×3 Grid**: Latin square pattern or (i + 2*j) % 3
   ```
   [0 2 1]
   [1 0 2]
   [2 1 0]
   ```

2. **4×4 Grid**: Checkerboard with alternating colors in 2×2 blocks
   ```
   [0 2 0 2]
   [1 0 1 0]
   [2 1 2 1]
   [0 2 0 2]
   ```

3. **6×6 Grid**: Block-based pattern with 2×2 blocks and different patterns per block
   ```
   [0 1 1 2 2 0]
   [2 0 0 1 1 2]
   [1 2 2 0 0 1]
   [0 1 1 2 2 0]
   [2 0 0 1 1 2]
   [1 2 2 0 0 1]
   ```

## Conclusion

The L-shape Ramsey problem demonstrates the challenges of combinatorial patterns and colorings. While some patterns work for specific grid sizes, finding a universal solution that works for all grid sizes remains challenging. 

For practical applications, a specialized approach based on the specific grid size appears to be the most effective strategy. This might involve using modular arithmetic for basic patterns, combined with specific adjustments at boundaries and key positions to avoid monochromatic L-shapes.
