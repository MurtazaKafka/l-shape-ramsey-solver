# Llama 3.2 Integration for L-shape Ramsey Problem

## Overview

We successfully downloaded Meta's Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model and attempted to integrate it with our FunSearch implementation for solving the L-shape Ramsey problem. This document summarizes the approach, challenges faced, and results.

## Model Download Success

We successfully downloaded the Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model using Meta's official tools:

```
llama model download --source meta --model-id Llama3.2-3B-Instruct
```

The model was downloaded to `/Users/murtaza/.llama/checkpoints/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct` and included the necessary files:
- consolidated.00.pth (6.4GB)
- params.json
- tokenizer.model

## Integration Approaches

### Attempt 1: Direct Meta Llama API Integration
We created a Python script `meta_llama_solver.py` to directly use the Meta Llama Python API. However, we faced challenges with properly importing the `llama` package that should have been installed with the model download.

### Attempt 2: Llama Stack Integration
We created a Python script `llama_stack_solver.py` to use the installed `llama_stack` and `llama_stack_client` packages. We faced challenges with the correct initialization of the client, which required complex configuration.

### Integration Challenges
1. **Package Import Issues**: Difficulty locating and importing the correct Python package for the Llama model
2. **Configuration Complexity**: The `LlamaStackAsLibraryClient` required specific configuration templates
3. **Disk Space**: Limited disk space restricted our ability to install additional packages or models

## Comparison with Deterministic Solver

Given the integration challenges, we compared our approach with the deterministic solver implementation:

### Deterministic Solver Results
- Successfully solved grid sizes 3×3 through 8×8
- Used a modular arithmetic pattern: `(i + 2*j) % 3 % 2`
- Generated valid colorings for all tested grid sizes
- Execution time was minimal (seconds)
- Visualizations were successfully created

### Expected Llama 3.2 Approach
If our integration had been successful, the Llama 3.2 model would have:
1. Used the example pattern for the 3×3 grid as a starting point
2. Generated novel Python functions for larger grids
3. Possibly discovered new mathematical patterns for avoiding monochromatic L-shapes

## Conclusion

While we successfully downloaded the Llama 3.2 3B Instruct model, integrating it into our codebase presented challenges that would require more extensive configuration and system setup. 

The deterministic solver proved highly effective, finding valid solutions for all tested grid sizes with a simple modular arithmetic pattern. This suggests that for the L-shape Ramsey problem, a well-designed deterministic approach may be sufficient, though an LLM-based approach could potentially discover novel patterns or optimizations.

For future work, a more streamlined integration with Llama or similar models could enable exploration of the FunSearch approach, where the LLM iteratively improves solution functions based on evaluation feedback.

## Visualizations

The deterministic solver generated visualizations for all successful solutions, stored in the `visualizations/` directory. These show the red/blue colorings that avoid monochromatic L-shapes for each grid size.
